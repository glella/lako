# Lako
Small & Easy Programming Language created with Rust based on the awesome Crafting Interpreters book https://craftinginterpreters.com/

Lako means Easy in Croatian/Bosnian

Follows closely the book to produce an Interpreted and a Compiled version as an exercise to learn about Compilers in a practical way.

Second phase will add refinements and capabilities to make it a moderately useful tiny language.

Interpreted Version
